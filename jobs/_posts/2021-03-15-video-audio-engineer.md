Filmhub takes the entire film distribution process online. For that, we're building web, mobile and TV applications in the cloud, using latest cutting-edge technologies for cloud services, frontend, video processing, and machine learning.

Filmhub is well funded by Silicon Valley investors, and co-founded by a Hollywood veteran (_Pirates of the Caribbean_).  We offer the perks of the big guys without the corporate feel. While we acknowledge film has a home in Los Angeles, we're a remote first team and believe you can work from wherever.
