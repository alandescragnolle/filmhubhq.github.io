On March 1, 2019 Amazon announced that pay rates in the US would no longer be on a tiered basis, but would have a base hourly rate modified by a “Customer Engagement Ranking.” (For exact amounts please log in or sign up to your [Filmhub account](https://filmhub.com)).

## How is Amazon’s Customer Engagement Ranking (“CER”) calculated?

Amazon is not disclosing the entire formula, but we have some insights about how it will work.

The "CER" is designed to measure engagement. Several objective factors are used in its calculation, including:

* _Unique Customers:_ How many different people are watching your title
* _View Length:_ How long people are watching your title

The CER also uses less objective factors:

* _Popularity:_ This involves talent, genre, IMDB ratings, and box office performance
* _Caliber:_ This is very subjective and includes aspects like quality of poster art, accurate metadata, localized subtitles and key art

## What can you do?

The subjective factors can be addressed. To start with, create specific streaming channel artwork, which is different than the traditional movie posters.

The real key is to drive traffic to your film. You know your audience and are now in control of your marketing and how to reach out to them.

We will continue to work with you to maximize your earnings on all channels.
