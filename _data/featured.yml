      “It makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist,”
      British novelist Sadie Smith wrote, Scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation,
      when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears —
      dissolution, disappearance.” In this selection of remarkable documentaries,
      we share the untold stories of immigrants.

      Despite its short history and imitation of Bollywood in the early days,
      Nepali cinema has found its own voice in recent years.
      Kollywood (named after Nepal’s capital and largest city Kathmandu)
      thrives as young filmmakers break into the mainstream, shaping the new Nepali narrative.
      Here are a few that represent the best and the most fun.

    description: |
      Here’s one of our favorite types of documentaries — the audience is taken on a journey
      in search of something (or someone) along with the protagonist (sometimes the filmmakers themselves),
      and get to experience every bit of excitement and frustration and joy and despair along the way.
      Besides being powerful, engaging, and irresistibly fun to watch,
      they also reveal a lot about the filmmaking process itself.
