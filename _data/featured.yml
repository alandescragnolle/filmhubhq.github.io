      to eyewitness testimonies of black veterans in WWI…This selection of rare and
      extraordinary documentaries barely scratched the surface, but it’s a start.

      Here’s one of our favorite types of documentaries — the audience is taken on a journey
      in search of something (or someone) along with the protagonist (sometimes the filmmakers themselves),
      and get to experience every bit of excitement and frustration and joy and despair along the way.
      Besides being powerful, engaging, and irresistibly fun to watch,
      they also reveal a lot about the filmmaking process itself.
