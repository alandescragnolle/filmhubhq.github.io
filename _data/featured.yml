      “It makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist,”
      British novelist Sadie Smith wrote, Scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation,
      when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears —
      dissolution, disappearance.” In this selection of remarkable documentaries,
      we share the untold stories of immigrants.

      and hear firsthand stories told by the artists themselves.

      Here’s one of our favorite types of documentaries — the audience is taken on a journey
      in search of something (or someone) along with the protagonist (sometimes the filmmakers themselves),
      and get to experience every bit of excitement and frustration and joy and despair along the way.
      Besides being powerful, engaging, and irresistibly fun to watch,
      they also reveal a lot about the filmmaking process itself.
